# Computational-Statistics

- Project 1: Generation of a uniform random variable (0,1) using the congruential method; generation of the standard normal table through numerical integration via Monte Carlo method.
- Project 2: Simulation of a discrete event (queue) and estimation of the mean squared error via Bootstrapping.
- Project 3: Two non-linear optimization methods (Gradient and PSO) with their respective convergence rates and average number of evaluations on the objective function by optimization.
- Project 4: EM algorithm to estimate the Gaussian parameters and the probability p of a mixture of Gaussians.
